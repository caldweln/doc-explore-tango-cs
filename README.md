Documentation Exploring Tango CS Framework

This repository holds documentation and code samples that comprise a suite of learning meterial for exploring the Tango CS Framework.

The aim is that the project will offer learning meterial that is:
 - project focused, without distracting from the Tango CS
 - individually self contained, with key learning points
 - successive, with a directed learning path
 
The initial introductory documents are to cover the common fundemental concepts of the Tango CS Framework. But each offering a different approach depending on the readers background. In this fashion, the reader can choose the one that offers the smallers barrier to entry.

The intention is to have 3 introductory papers each implementing the same project, and covering the same fundemental Tango concepts. However, each using a Tango toolset (of a particular programming language) particular to a programmers background that covers:
 - Python Approach: Tango fundementals, PyTango, Taurus
 - Java Approach: Tango fundementals, Pogo (Java), QTango
 - C++ Approach: Tango fundementals, Pogo (C++), ATK

Following this a set of intermediary and advanced papers will explore more sophisticated aspects of the framework in a more heterogeneous fashion.
