Documentation Exploring Tango CS Framework

This repository holds documentation and code samples that comprise a suite of learning meterial for exploring the Tango CS framework.

 - project focused, without distracting from Tango CS
 - individually self contained, with key learning points
 - successive in nature, discovering lower level and sophisticated concepts and tools
